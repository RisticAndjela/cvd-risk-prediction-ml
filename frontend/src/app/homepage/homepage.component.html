    <h2>What is cardiovascular risk?</h2>
    <p>
      Cardiovascular risk represents the <strong>probability of developing heart or blood vessel diseases</strong>,
      such as heart attack, stroke, or hypertension, based on lifestyle and health indicators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. They include conditions such as
      coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). CVD is the leading cause
      of death globally, but many cases can be prevented with early detection and lifestyle changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and
      an unhealthy diet. Genetic factors and age also play a role.

    <h2>How this app helps</h2>
    <p>
      Our tool uses <strong>machine learning</strong> trained on medical data to estimate the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
      It analyzes factors such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Age, gender, height, and weight</li>
      <li>Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)</li>
      <li>Cholesterol and glucose levels</li>
      <li>Smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity</li>
    </ul>
